# SummerProject2014

The main software used in this internship was COMSOL Multiphysics. It is a software used to model and simulate scientific and engineering problems. Most of work was to model the Zeplin-III chamber detector and create good meshing around the model to simulate the electric field inside the chamber.

•	Modelled a Zeplin-III chamber detector on COMSOL Multiphysics
•	Obtained data and plotted various graphs with different constraint values
•	Helped the research group in understanding the insides of the Zeplin-III detector using the  COMSOL model.
•	Helped a postdoc colleague with mechanical work inside the laboratory 
•	Analysed current data sets 
•	Performed analytical calculations and compare them with the current data sets
